		Dear God,
		I pray today that You would help me in my search for the meaning of my life and why I’m alive; why You put me on this Earth at this time.  And I really want to know my purpose.  Sometimes I feel so lost.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just wandering with no end goal in sight.  And I'm asking You today just to show me and remind me again that You have a great plan for my life; even if I don't understand it, even if I don't see exactly where I'm headed.  I pray that You would renew my faith today and help me to believe in Your great plan and that You have a purpose.  And that all things that I’ve experienced and all my passions and all my dreams, that they will come together; that You will use them for a greater good and that I can be used on this Earth to serve You and to give back to others and to be fulfilled myself.  And that I am able to know through You, through Your love, the reason that I'm alive and that I don't have to worry about being lost anymore.  So I thank you God, that today's a new day that today I can believe again.  And I don't have to give up and I don't have to feel like I'm wandering aimlessly anymore.  Because You have a great plan in mind and I trust that You’re gonna show me every step of the way. 
		In Jesus’ name, 
		Amen
		</p>
