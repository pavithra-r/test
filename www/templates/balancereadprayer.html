God I thank You that You are not a God of chaos, but You are a God of peace and order and stability and balance.  And God I thank You that Your Word says that we can come to You and ask You for wisdom; that we can come to You and ask You for peace that surpasses all understanding.  And God, that we can come to You and ask You for help.  So God, I just come to You right now and I ask You for help; that You would help me to prioritize and balance my daily activities; that You would help me to balance the different aspects of my life.  God, as I feel out of balance and as I feel in the midst of chaos with stress from work and stress from relationships and trying to fit everything in that’s important.  God I pray that You would help me to prioritize and bring balance back into my life.  God I also know that Your Word says that in Your presence is fullness of joy.  God that You say that if we put You at the head, that everything else will be balanced.  And so God, I commit to You right now to put You back in the center of all of my activities. I put You back at the forefront of my life.  God I commit to You that that You're the most important; that I’ll spend time with you God.  I commit my day to You, my morning routine You.  God and I thank you that You want balance in my life.  So God I ask for it.  You say that anything that we ask for in Your name will be given to us.  And so I ask You for balance.  I ask that as I commit to put You back at the forefront of my life, God that You would help me to have balance in all other areas: in my family, in my friendships, at work, in my leisurely time, in my health, with my eating habits, and my exercise.  God I pray that You would help me prioritize; you would help me to not feel stressed.  God that you would help me to feel peace and to have a more orderly and balanced life.
