Dear God, 

Sometimes it’s so hard for me to know and believe that I’m loved.Sometimes I don’t feel loved.Sometimes I feel really overlooked and I don’t even know if anyone in this world values me.  I know that I should believe that. I know that you say that you love me and I really want to know that.  But God, I also want to feel that.  And I want to experience Your love because I feel like I just don't know that yet. And I feel like there’s such a lack in my life of experiencing being truly loved and truly seen and truly known.  And I know that You can give me this; I just haven’t had it yet, God.  And so I'm asking You today to show me Your great love and I’m asking You to show me how to experience being loved by You and what that’s like.  I know that it’s supposed to be really fulfilling, I know that I’m supposed to be whole from Your love and healed and really know my value because of the way that You love me.  God, I see that You've done this for other people and I just ask You for another dose of Your love and I pray that You would help me open my heart so I can receive more and more of Your love for me.  
God, I don't want to miss out and I don't want to live not knowing this great love that You have to offer that nobody else can give.  So please help me to experience Your deep and endless love for me today and every day, more and more, in greater measure.

In Jesus’ name, 
Amen.
