I can't get away from the disappointment, the restlessness, and the feeling that I have potential to go further and do more than I'm doing now.  Your word in Proverbs 13:12 says, “Hope deferred makes the heart grow sick, but a longing fulfilled is the tree of life.”  I have so much hope deferred that I'm scared to hope and be disappointed yet again.  it's hard not to be mad at You, but Your Word says that You are good and You have good things for those of us that are called according to Your purposes.  Maybe I'm hoping for the wrong things. God I want to desire the things that are a good fit for me; things that really will give me life when those desires have been obtained.  I'm sick of chasing after things that leave me empty.  Teach me how to be content with what I have and choose things that are good for me.  Thank you that you created me for a purpose. I choose that purpose today. Help me to find it and help me to walk away from the things that harm me and leave me empty.  Thank you for Your love.  Thank you that You love me. Thank you that You hear and answer my prayers",

You have taught me that when I do it for myself, I will have some success, but when I allow You to do it, You will place me in realms I never dreamed of.  And I have seen that, Lord. You are not partial to certain people.  You are good to everyone all over the world.  So, Lord, I pray right now, that I will get a deep understanding of this fact and that I will turn my life totally over to You.  I pray for understanding that real fulfillment in life comes from doing Your plan for my life.  Open my eyes to this truth, Lord and may life's greatest joys come to me as I do it.",

Sometimes I feel really overlooked and I don’t even know if anyone in this world values me.  I know that I should believe that.  I know that you say that you love me and I really want to know that.  But God, I also want to feel that.  And I want to experience Your love because I feel like I just don't know that yet. And I feel like there’s such a lack in my life of experiencing being truly loved and truly seen and truly known.  And I know that You can give me this; I just haven’t had it yet, God.  And so I'm asking You today to show me Your great love and I’m asking You to show me how to experience being loved by You and what that’s like.  I know that it’s supposed to be really fulfilling, I know that I’m supposed to be whole from Your love and healed and really know my value because of the way that You love me.  God, I see that You've done this for other people and I just ask You for another dose of Your love and I pray that You would help me open my heart so I can receive more and more of Your love for me.God, I don't want to miss out and I don't want to live not knowing this great love that You have to offer that nobody else can give.  So please help me to experience Your deep and endless love for me today and every day, more and more, in greater measure.",
